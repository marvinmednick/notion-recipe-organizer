# Special Notes:
# - Precedence determines conflict resolution (lower number = higher precedence)
# - "Not a Recipe" has highest precedence for completely unrelated content
# - "Cooking Reference" for food-related articles, tips, and reference materials - Ingredient lists (even without instructions) are treated as recipes if for specific dishes
# - Smoothie ingredients go in Breakfast if breakfast-focused, Vegetarian if general
# - Spice mixes and condiment recipes typically go in Sides & Appetizers
